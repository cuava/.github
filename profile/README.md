# Cube-OS

Cube-OS is an OpenSource Linux based operating system and framework for CubeSats and other satellites. (based on [KubOS](https://github.com/kubos))

On this page you find all the repositories you need to run your own satellite.

[More Documentation can be found here](https://github.com/Cube-OS)

## Cube-OS SDK
Please follow the instructions provided in the repository to install the Cube-OS SDK

## Compile your service (requires rust 1.55.0 or above)
As shown above, **cubeos-service** uses features so the user can decide the use case at compile time.

**UDP handling**

`cargo build`

or with cross compiler

`cargo kubos -c build --target kubos-linux-isis-gcc -- --release` (requires KubOS SDK)

**Ground:**

`cargo build --features ground`

Additionally the UDP handling and Ground features can be combined with **debug**, e.g.:
`cargo build --features debug`
`cargo build --features ground,debug`

## Run a service
To run a service simply transfer the executable to the satellite or ground station to a desired folder (e.g. /home/kubos/) and run:

`./executable`

This requires a config file `/etc/kubos-config.toml`. Alternatively run the executable with the -c flag to specify a config file:

`./executable -c path/to/config`

## Troubleshooting
CubeOS uses git ssh URL's for dependencies within the Organisation. Pls make sure to add your to the repository:

**start ssh-agent**
```` eval `ssh-agent` ````

**add key (in repo)**
`ssh-add ~/.ssh/$your-key`
e.g. ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
